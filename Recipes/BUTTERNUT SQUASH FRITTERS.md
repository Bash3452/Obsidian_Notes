- 2.5 cups shredded butternut squash, lightly packed - 1/3 cup all-purpose flour (most flours should work) - 1 large eggs, lightly beaten - 1.5 Tablespoons minced fresh sage (or other herb of choice) - Salt & pepper to taste **Place all ingredients in a bowl and combine well ** Have a pan pre heated on medium high heat ** Spray pan or use a little bit of oil then place your fritters into desired sizes on the pan and cook for 3 minutes. Flip the fritters and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes until golden brown ** I love having these with some greek yogurt. Try it out!
